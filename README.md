NUSPlanner
==

NUSPlanner is an academic planning tool to let students check if their academic plan will fulfil their degree requirements. It allows students to plan which modules they wish to take for each semester of study and lets them check if their plan will meet their graduation requirements. We also ensure that pre-reqs are fulfilled, degree requirements are clearly set out, and provide students with a sample study plan to start off which they can further edit. NUSPlanner will ensure that graduation requirements will never be a concern again :)
